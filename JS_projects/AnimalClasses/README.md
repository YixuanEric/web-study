Now the game is playable. The player first choose an animal class.If the player get the animals' names right for 5 times, the player can move on to another animal class.But because it is a small-scale project, some of its random events are not truly random and can
be considered as hard coded.

This is the assignment 5 version and the animal name guessing part has not been done yet,
the audio message should works fine. Now the photo area is just a auto-play slideshow.
